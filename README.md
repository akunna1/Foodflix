# Foodflix üç¥

Foodflix is a Netflix-inspired recipe web app where I share my personal meal plans and recipes, blending American, Jamaican, Greek, Nigerian, and other global flavors. The app also helps me figure out what to eat, while giving users a visually engaging and interactive way to explore delicious food.
