# Foodflix 🍴

Foodflix is a **Netflix-inspired recipe web app** where I share my personal meal plans and recipes, blending **American, Jamaican, Greek, Nigerian**, and other global flavors 🌎. The app also helps me figure out what to eat 🥗, while giving users a visually engaging and interactive way to explore **delicious food** 😋.
